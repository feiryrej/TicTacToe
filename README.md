# Details 🎀
This is a polished version of a Tic-Tac-Toe game originally created by one of my friends. I've given it a fresh design using my own CSS. To play:

1. Click on an empty square to make your move.
2. Alternately, players take turns to place their 'X' or 'O' in any available square.
3. The first player to get three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
4. If all squares are filled and no player has three in a row, the game is a draw.
5. Enjoy the game and have fun!
